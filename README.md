Hello Everyone!

This is my CS50 Problem set 0. This Project is created by using Scratch. In this project I selected two sprites and there is a little bit of conversation between two sprites, And then one sprite will perform some basic calculations for other. Like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and division. I created a simple calculator using scratch.

It's my start and I am learning new things and hope to create more intreseting repos for others.
