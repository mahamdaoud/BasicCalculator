# BasicCalculator
This program is created using Scratch. It will perform simple calculations. Like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

Hello Everyone!

This is my CS50 Problem set 0. This Project is created by using Scratch. In this project, I selected two sprites and there is a little bit of conversation between the two sprites, one spirit will perform some basic calculations for the other, like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and division. I created a simple calculator using scratch.
In this project, I used conditional statements, loops, and variables. I also created my own block that will do calculations.

It's my start and I am learning new things and hope to create more interesting repos for others.

#How does it work?

Simply download the file onto your computer and then open it with a scratch in your computer. If you don't have scratch download it from the internet. Thank you!
